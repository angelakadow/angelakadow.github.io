				I fell in love with the joy of making music while attending Lakewood City Schools in Lakewood, Ohio. Learning to play the flute in 5th Grade was difficult for me, and I received some extra help from my band teacher. This teacherâ€™s dedication and exuberance made me feel valued, so I continued to play. While in high school, I decided I wanted to teach music. I had wanted to be a teacher since 2nd grade, and teaching music allowed me to combine my passions for music and teaching.

				I broadened my horizons while majoring in Music Education at Cleveland State University. I continued to play my flute in band and take flute lessons. I began singing in choir and taking voice lessons as well. The combination of flute, voice and methods classes for woodwind, brass, percussion and string instruments has exposed me to teaching many classroom instruments.

				I embarked on my teaching journey as a substitute teacher through the North Coast Shared Services Alliance in Cuyahoga and Lorain counties. I substituted in classrooms ranging from Pre-K-12th grade. This past school year, I taught K-8 General Music and 5-8 Band at St. Peter School in Lorain, Ohio. I organized 2 concerts: a Christmas Concert featuring 1st-3rd grade choirs and an 8th grade bucket drumming ensemble, and a Spring Concert showcasing Kindergarten, 4th grade and Band. Please check out the teaching highlights section of the website to explore the units I created while teaching at St. Peter.
