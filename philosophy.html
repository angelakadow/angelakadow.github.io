				<div class="philo" id="why">Why do I teach music?</div>
			<p id="par1">
				Learning music builds skills including: community, listening, communication, collaboration, creativity, and dedication.
			</p>
			<p id='par2'>
				Each of these skills are presented in a unique environment in music class, allowing students to translate them to their life. In today's world of social media and heavy use of smart phones, children often become isolated. According to a study published in the <a id="apj" target="_blank" href="http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1998-10886-001">American Psychologists Journal</a>, "greater use of the Internet is associated with declines in participants' communication with family members in the household, declines in the size of their social circle, and increases in their depression and loneliness."
			</p>
			<p id="par3">
				Music teaches us to think creatively and problem solve, skills that are invaluable in today's world. Students learn how to work together and fashion innovative ideas. which are valuable skills in the workplace.
			</p>
			<p id="par4">
				My teaching emphasizes these skills. For example, students create short fables and musical themes to accompany them during my Peter and the wolf unit. Units like these emphasize interdisciplinary learning, project based learning, collaboration and creativity.
			</p>
			<div class="philo" id="how">How do I teach music?</div>
			<p id="par5">
				My music teaching emphasizes the tenets of Music Learning Theory, or that music is learned as any other language. We learn to imitate and speak before we learn to read and write. Developing students listening abilities before they learn to read music gives them the skills they need to read, perform, and compose music. Many music methodologies and philosophies emphasize this outlook, including the SongWorks methodology I describe below.
			</p>
			<p>What does this look like?</p>
			<p>
				In my music class, students experience music in a multitude of ways including singing, playing instruments, moving and compositing. For example, when I teach a song we:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Story plop, or I sing the song and ask students questions about it
				</li>
				<li>
					I sing the song and the students tap steady beat
				</li>
				<li>
					We sing the song together
				</li>
				<li>
					Choose an element for study such as rhythm: Follow the steady beat and rhythm with a pointer while the rest of the class sings the song and build the rhythmic notation together.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="par6">
				Music provides a fusion of creative critical thinking, collaboration and listening in a way that other subjects do not. I consider it my mission as a teacher to help students discover why music is important and how it can help them.
