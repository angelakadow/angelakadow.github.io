      Hello! Thank you for visiting my website!
      </p>
      <p>
      The Portfolio section of this website features my ideal music curriculum, unit plans, lesson
      plans and a video of me teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
      Why do I want to teach music? The answer lies within my life’s journey. I fell in love with the joy of making music while attending Lakewood City Schools in Lakewood, Ohio. Learning to play
      the flute in 5th Grade was difficult for me, and I received some extra help from my band
      teacher. This teacher’s dedication and exuberance made me feel valued, so I continued to play.
      While in high school, I decided I wanted to teach music. I had wanted to be a teacher since
      2nd grade, and teaching music allowed me to combine my passions for music and teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
      I broadened my horizons while majoring in Music Education at Cleveland State University.
      I continued to play my flute in band and take flute lessons. I began singing in the choir and
      taking voice lessons as well. The combination of flute, voice and methods classes for
      woodwind, brass, percussion and string instruments has exposed me to teaching many
      classroom instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
      My passion for teaching intensified during my field experiences, student teaching and
      substitute teaching. I want to teach because I am able to help people become the best
      versions of themselves by thinking critically and creatively through music. Music is unique
      because it challenges us to listen, think creatively and collaborate with others.
      I strive to be a teacher that engages my students with hands on activities that allow students to
      experience music in different ways, which is evidenced in my curriculum and lesson plans.
      </p>
      <p>
      I am currently a substitute teacher for the North Coast Shared Services Alliance, and have
      substituted for various schools in Cuyahoga and Lorain counties. I am currently looking for a
      job as a music teacher. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or for an interview.
